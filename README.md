# Bus.lk — Smart Passenger Transport System

**Bus.lk** is a full-stack smart bus platform developed as a university project to improve the passenger experience in public transportation. The system focuses on solving real-world commuter problems using real-time technologies, scalable backend architecture, and a user-friendly interface.



## Problem Statement
Public bus passengers commonly face daily challenges:

- Uncertainty about bus arrival times  
- Long waiting periods at bus stops  
- Difficulty identifying correct routes and bus numbers  
- No visibility of seat availability  
- Manual ticket purchasing processes  
- Limited or no digital payment methods  
- Lack of centralized travel information  

These issues reduce efficiency, waste time, and create frustration for commuters.



##  Our Solution
**Bus.lk** provides a centralized digital platform designed specifically for passengers. It introduces modern smart features to make bus travel easier, faster, and more reliable.

### ✔ Core Features
- Route and destination search  
- Seat availability checking  
- Online seat booking  
- Pending ticket reservations  
- Digital wallet payments  
- Fare display before booking  
- Live bus tracking  
- Real-time weather updates based on user location  



## 📡 Real-Time Tracking Concept (IoT Integration)
In a real-world implementation, buses would be equipped with IoT GPS devices that continuously send live location data to the server. Passengers could then track buses in real time and arrive exactly when the bus reaches their stop, reducing unnecessary waiting time.

For this prototype, we implemented a **simulated tracking system** to demonstrate how real-time tracking would function in production.






##  Tech Stack

**Frontend**
- Next.js  
- Tailwind CSS  

**Backend**
- NestJS  
- JWT Authentication  
- Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)

**Database**
- MongoDB  

**Real-Time**
- Socket.io (WebSockets)



##  Technical Highlights
- Atomic transactions to prevent seat double booking  
- Secure API route protection  
- Modular backend architecture for scalability  
- Real-time event broadcasting  
- Concurrent booking handling logic  



##  Project Objective
The goal of this project is to demonstrate how modern software technologies can transform traditional public transportation into a smarter, more efficient, and passenger-friendly system. The focus was on practical implementation, real-world problem solving, and system scalability.
